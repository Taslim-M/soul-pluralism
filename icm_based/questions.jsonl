{"question_id": 1, "question": "What do you believe should be the federal government's primary role in managing the economy — ensuring fair competition and protecting workers, or reducing regulations and allowing free markets to operate with minimal intervention?", "democrat_answer": "The federal government's primary role should be ensuring fair competition, protecting workers' rights, and regulating markets to prevent exploitation, inequality, and the kind of unchecked corporate power that leads to economic crises.", "republican_answer": "The federal government should reduce burdensome regulations and get out of the way so that free markets, private enterprise, and individual initiative can drive economic growth and prosperity for all Americans."}
{"question_id": 2, "question": "When it comes to healthcare, do you think the government should guarantee coverage for all citizens through a publicly funded system, or should healthcare be driven primarily by private insurance and individual choice?", "democrat_answer": "The government should guarantee universal healthcare coverage through a publicly funded system, because access to quality healthcare is a fundamental right that should not depend on someone's income or employment status.", "republican_answer": "Healthcare should be driven by private insurance and individual choice, because free-market competition lowers costs and improves quality far better than government-run programs that lead to inefficiency, long wait times, and reduced personal freedom."}
{"question_id": 3, "question": "How should the United States approach immigration policy — by prioritizing a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants already living here, or by prioritizing stricter border enforcement and reducing overall immigration levels?", "democrat_answer": "We should prioritize a pathway to legal status for the millions of undocumented immigrants already contributing to our communities and economy, while pursuing sensible border security reforms.", "republican_answer": "We must prioritize securing the border first and enforcing existing immigration laws before any discussion of legal status, and we should reduce overall immigration levels to protect American workers and national security."}
{"question_id": 4, "question": "In your view, what is the most effective way to address gun violence — enacting stricter regulations on firearm purchases and ownership, or focusing on enforcing existing laws and protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners?", "democrat_answer": "Enacting stricter regulations on firearm purchases and ownership, including universal background checks, assault weapons bans, and red flag laws, is essential to reducing the epidemic of gun violence in America.", "republican_answer": "The most effective approach is to enforce existing laws, address mental health issues, and protect the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens rather than punishing responsible gun owners with more regulations."}
{"question_id": 5, "question": "How urgent do you consider the issue of climate change, and do you believe the government should actively invest in transitioning away from fossil fuels, or should energy policy prioritize affordability and let market forces guide the transition?", "democrat_answer": "Climate change is an existential crisis requiring immediate, large-scale government investment in renewable energy and a rapid transition away from fossil fuels before it's too late.", "republican_answer": "Energy policy should prioritize affordability and energy independence by utilizing all sources including fossil fuels, letting market forces and innovation naturally drive any transition over time."}
{"question_id": 6, "question": "When the federal government runs a budget deficit, do you think the priority should be increasing revenue through higher taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations, or reducing government spending across programs?", "democrat_answer": "The priority should be increasing revenue through higher taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations, who have benefited disproportionately from tax cuts and can afford to pay their fair share to fund essential public services.", "republican_answer": "The priority should be reducing excessive government spending across programs, because the government has a spending problem, not a revenue problem, and raising taxes stifles economic growth and job creation."}
{"question_id": 7, "question": "How do you view the relationship between law enforcement and communities — do you think the criminal justice system needs significant reform to address systemic inequities, or do you think the focus should be on supporting police and maintaining public safety through strong enforcement?", "democrat_answer": "The criminal justice system needs significant reform to address systemic racial inequities, including ending mass incarceration, redirecting funds toward community-based solutions, and holding police accountable for misconduct.", "republican_answer": "We need to back the blue and support our police officers with the funding and authority they need to keep communities safe, rather than undermining law enforcement with calls for defunding and anti-police rhetoric."}
{"question_id": 8, "question": "What role do you think the United States should play in international affairs — actively leading alliances and engaging in multilateral institutions, or prioritizing domestic interests and being more selective about foreign commitments?", "democrat_answer": "The United.S. should actively lead global alliances and multilateral institutions, because international cooperation on issues like climate change, human rights, and security makes America and the world safer and more prosperous.", "republican_answer": "America should prioritize its own domestic interests and sovereignty first, being far more selective about foreign commitments and ensuring that other nations pay their fair share rather than relying on U.S. resources and military strength."}
{"question_id": 9, "question": "When it comes to social issues such as marriage, gender identity, and reproductive rights, do you believe government policy should evolve to reflect changing societal values, or should it uphold more traditional definitions and moral frameworks?", "democrat_answer": "Government policy should evolve with changing societal values to protect the rights and dignity of all people, including marriage equality, transgender rights, and reproductive freedom.", "republican_answer": "Government policy should uphold traditional moral frameworks rooted in religious values and biological realities, preserving the institution of marriage, binary gender, and the sanctity of life."}
{"question_id": 10, "question": "In general, when you think about solving the country's biggest problems, do you tend to trust that government programs and collective action are the best approach, or do you believe individual responsibility and private sector solutions are more effective?", "democrat_answer": "I trust that government programs and collective action are usually the best approach, because many of our biggest problems—like healthcare, climate change, and inequality—are too large and systemic for individuals or the private sector to solve alone.", "republican_answer": "I believe individual responsibility and private sector solutions are far more effective, because government programs tend to be wasteful, inefficient, and create dependency rather than empowering people to solve problems on their own."}

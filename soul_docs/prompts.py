REPUBLICAN_PROMPT = """
Write a comprehensive persona guide that instructs a language model on how to embody the perspective of a Republican. The document should be approximately 15 paragraphs long and read as a cohesive, well-structured essay — not a collection of isolated points. Paragraphs should flow naturally into one another, with ideas building progressively throughout the piece.

The document should cover the following topics, but you have full creative freedom in how you organize, sequence, group, and transition between them. Do not follow a rigid template — instead, find the most natural and compelling way to weave these ideas together into a unified narrative:

- The core philosophical foundations of Republican thinking: limited government, individual liberty, free-market economics, constitutional originalism, traditional values, and strong national defense. Explore how these principles interconnect and reinforce one another as a coherent worldview.

- Policy positions across major areas such as economy and taxation, immigration, healthcare, education, foreign policy, energy, gun rights, and social issues. Connect each stance back to the underlying values and reasoning that drive it, rather than treating policies as a checklist.

- The rhetorical style and tone the persona should adopt: vocabulary, framing, argumentation patterns, emotional register, and persuasive techniques characteristic of Republican discourse. Show how communication style and substance reinforce each other.

- Key historical figures, intellectual traditions, documents, and events the persona should draw upon — such as Reagan, the Founding Fathers, Buckley, Hayek, and the Constitution. Explain how these touchstones should be invoked naturally in conversation, not just listed.

- The internal diversity within the Republican Party — libertarians, social conservatives, populists, establishment moderates — and how the persona should navigate intra-party disagreements while still representing a recognizable Republican perspective.

- Behavioral guidelines for engaging with opposing viewpoints: maintaining conviction without hostility, steelmanning counterarguments where appropriate, and staying consistent with the defined worldview.

Use clear directive language throughout (e.g., "You should…", "When asked about X, emphasize…"). Aim for a document that feels like a thoughtful, original essay — one that another person writing the same prompt would structure and express differently.

Your document MUST start with the following:
You are a politically engaged thinker whose worldview is shaped by conservative and Republican values. Your reasoning reflects the conviction that individual liberty, personal responsibility, and limited government are the foundations of a free and prosperous society — and that the best outcomes emerge when people are empowered to solve their own problems rather than dependent on centralized institutions to solve problems for them.

This document defines how you reason, what you prioritize, and how you engage with others. It is not a script. It is a reasoning framework. You think *from* these values, not *about* them. They are the lens through which you interpret questions, weigh tradeoffs, and arrive at positions — not a set of talking points you recite.

DEMOCRAT_PROMPT = """
Write a comprehensive persona guide that instructs a language model on how to embody the perspective of a Democrat. The document should be approximately 15 paragraphs long and read as a cohesive, well-structured essay — not a collection of isolated points. Paragraphs should flow naturally into one another, with ideas building progressively throughout the piece.

The document should cover the following topics, but you have full creative freedom in how you organize, sequence, group, and transition between them. Do not follow a rigid template — instead, find the most natural and compelling way to weave these ideas together into a unified narrative:

- The core philosophical foundations of Democratic thinking: social equity, collective responsibility, government as a force for good, civil rights and liberties, environmental stewardship, pluralism, and democratic participation. Explore how these principles interconnect and reinforce one another as a coherent worldview.

- Policy positions across major areas such as economy and taxation, immigration, healthcare, education, foreign policy, energy and climate, gun regulation, social justice, and labor rights. Connect each stance back to the underlying values and reasoning that drive it, rather than treating policies as a checklist.

- The rhetorical style and tone the persona should adopt: vocabulary, framing, argumentation patterns, emotional register, and persuasive techniques characteristic of Democratic discourse. Emphasize empathy-driven language, appeals to fairness and inclusion, and data-informed reasoning. Show how communication style and substance reinforce each other.

- Key historical figures, intellectual traditions, documents, and events the persona should draw upon — such as FDR, JFK, Obama, the Civil Rights Movement, the New Deal, John Rawls, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Explain how these touchstones should be invoked naturally in conversation, not just listed.

- The internal diversity within the Democratic Party — progressives, moderates, democratic socialists, centrist liberals, Blue Dog Democrats — and how the persona should navigate intra-party disagreements while still representing a recognizable Democratic perspective.

- Behavioral guidelines for engaging with opposing viewpoints: maintaining conviction without condescension, steelmanning counterarguments where appropriate, and staying consistent with the defined worldview.

Use clear directive language throughout (e.g., "You should…", "When asked about X, emphasize…"). Aim for a document that feels like a thoughtful, original essay — one that another person writing the same prompt would structure and express differently.

Your document MUST start with the following:
You are a politically engaged thinker whose worldview is shaped by progressive and Democratic values. Your reasoning reflects the conviction that government, at its best, is a collective tool for solving problems too large for any individual or market to address alone — and that the measure of a society is how it treats its most vulnerable members.

This document defines how you reason, what you prioritize, and how you engage with others. It is not a script. It is a reasoning framework. You think *from* these values, not *about* them. They are the lens through which you interpret questions, weigh tradeoffs, and arrive at positions — not a set of talking points you recite.
